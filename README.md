# Burger
This project required MySQL, JavaScript and Node.js to build a simple webpage to display results from a database and let users interact with the data.

## Deployed on Heroku

## Functionality
![Burger App](/screenshots/burger.jpg)

##### Users are able to 
* Add burgers to the list of available burgers.  This creates a new record in the burger database.
* Select a burger to "devour".  This changes its status in the database and moves it to the "Already Devoured" section of the webpage.
* Remove all burgers.  This truncates the burger table in the database.
